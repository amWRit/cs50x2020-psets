(https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2020/)

## Week 0 Scratch üò∫
Implement in Scratch any project of your choice, be it an interactive story, game, animation, or anything else, subject 

## Week 1 C
### Hello
Modify this program in such a way that it first prompts the user for their name and then prints hello, so-and-so, 
where so-and-so is their actual name.

### Mario (less)
Recreate the Mario pyramid in C, albeit in text, using hashes (#) for bricks, a la the below.
Allow the user to decide just how tall the pyramid should be by first prompting them for a positive integer between, 
say, 1 and 8, inclusive.

Here‚Äôs how the program might work if the user inputs 8 when prompted:

````
$ ./mario
Height: 8
       #
      ##
     ###
    ####
   #####
  ######
 #######
########
````

### Mario (more)
Here‚Äôs how the program might work if the user inputs 8 when prompted:

````
$ ./mario
Height: 8
       #  #
      ##  ##
     ###  ###
    ####  ####
   #####  #####
  ######  ######
 #######  #######
########  ########
````

### Cash
Implement a program that first asks the user how much change is owed and then prints the minimum number of coins with which that change can be made.

````
Your program should behave per the examples below.

$ ./cash
Change owed: 0.41
4

$ ./cash
Change owed: -0.41
Change owed: foo
Change owed: 0.41
4
````

### Credit
Write a program that prompts the user for a credit card number and then reports (via printf) whether 
it is a valid American Express, MasterCard, or Visa card number.

Most cards use an algorithm invented by Hans Peter Luhn of IBM. According to Luhn‚Äôs algorithm, you can determine if a 
credit card number is (syntactically) valid.

Consider the below representative of how your own program should behave when passed a valid credit card number (sans hyphens).
````
$ ./credit
Number: 4003600000000014
VISA

$ ./credit
Number: 4003-6000-0000-0014
Number: foo
Number: 4003600000000014
VISA

$ ./credit
Number: 6176292929
INVALID
````

## Week 2 Arrays
### Caesar
Implement a program that encrypts messages using Caesar‚Äôs cipher, per the below.
````
$ ./caesar 13
plaintext:  HELLO
ciphertext: URYYB
````
Here are a few examples of how the program might work. For example, if the user inputs a key of 1 and a plaintext of HELLO:
````
$ ./caesar 1
plaintext:  HELLO
ciphertext: IFMMP
````

Here‚Äôs how the program might work if the user provides a key of 13 and a plaintext of hello, world:
````
$ ./caesar 13
plaintext:  hello, world
ciphertext: uryyb, jbeyq
````

 Here‚Äôs how the program might work if the user provides a key of 13 again, with a more complex plaintext:
````
$ ./caesar 13
plaintext:  be sure to drink your Ovaltine
ciphertext: or fher gb qevax lbhe Binygvar
````

### Readability
Implement a program that computes the approximate grade level needed to comprehend some text, per the below.
````
$ ./readability
Text: Congratulations! Today is your day. You're off to Great Places! You're off and away!
Grade 3
````

A number of ‚Äúreadability tests‚Äù have been developed over the years, to give a formulaic process for computing the reading level of a text.

One such readability test is the Coleman-Liau index. The Coleman-Liau index of a text is designed to output what (U.S.) grade level is needed to understand the text. The formula is:

````index = 0.0588 * L - 0.296 * S - 15.8````

Here, __L__ is the average number of letters per 100 words in the text, and __S__ is the average number of sentences per
 100 words in the text.

Let‚Äôs write a program called readability that takes a text and determines its reading level. For example, if user types in a line from Dr. Seuss:
````
$ ./readability
Text: Congratulations! Today is your day. You're off to Great Places! You're off and away!
Grade 3
````

## Week 3 Algorithms
###Plurality
Implement a program that runs a plurality election, per the below.
````
$ ./plurality Alice Bob Charlie

Alice

$ ./plurality Alice Bob Charlie
Number of voters: 5
Vote: Alice
Vote: Charlie
Vote: Bob
Vote: Bob
Vote: Alice
Alice
Bob
````

### Runoff
Implement a program that runs a runoff election, per the below.
````
./runoff Alice Bob Charlie
Number of voters: 5
Rank 1: Alice
Rank 2: Bob
Rank 3: Charlie

Rank 1: Alice
Rank 2: Charlie
Rank 3: Bob

Rank 1: Bob
Rank 2: Charlie
Rank 3: Alice

Rank 1: Bob
Rank 2: Alice
Rank 3: Charlie

Rank 1: Charlie
Rank 2: Alice
Rank 3: Bob

Alice
````

## Week 4 Memory
### Filter

````
$ ./filter -r image.bmp reflected.bmp
````

Your program should behave per the examples below.
````
$ ./filter -g infile.bmp outfile.bmp
$ ./filter -s infile.bmp outfile.bmp
$ ./filter -r infile.bmp outfile.bmp
$ ./filter -b infile.bmp outfile.bmp
````

````
g = grayscale, s = sepia, r = reflection, b =blur
````

### Recover
Implement a program that recovers JPEGs from a forensic image, per the below.
````
$ ./recover card.raw
````

````
$ python dna.py databases/large.csv sequences/5.txt
Lavender
````
Your task is to write a program that will take a sequence of DNA and a CSV file containing STR (Short Tandem Repeats) 
counts for a list of individuals and then output to whom the DNA (most likely) belongs.

## Week 7 SQL
### Movies
Write SQL queries to answer questions about a database of movies.

To test your queries on CS50 IDE, you can query the database by running
````

## Week 8 Information
### Web Track
Build a simple homepage using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

#### Homepage
Implement in your homepage directory a website that must:
- Contain at least four different .html pages, at least one of which is index.html (the main page of your website), and
 it should be possible to get from any page on your website to any other page by following one or more hyperlinks.
- Use at least ten (10) distinct HTML tags besides <html>, <head>, <body>, and <title>. Using some tag (e.g., <p>) 
multiple times still counts as just one (1) of those ten!
- Integrate one or more features from Bootstrap into your site. Bootstrap is a popular library (that comes with lots of
 CSS classes and more) via which you can beautify your site. See Bootstrap‚Äôs documentation to get started. To add Bootstrap to your site, it suffices to include

#### Finance
Implement a website via which users can ‚Äúbuy‚Äù and ‚Äúsell‚Äù stocks, a la the below.
(https://finance.cs50.net/)

- It allows a user to register for an account via a form.
- It allows a user to look up a stock‚Äôs current price.
- It enables a user to buy stocks.
- It displays an HTML table summarizing, for the user currently logged in, which stocks the user owns, the numbers of 
shares owned, the current price of each stock, and the total value of each holding (i.e., shares times price). 
Also display the user‚Äôs current cash balance along with a grand total (i.e., stocks‚Äô total value plus cash).
- It enables a user to sell shares of a stock (that he or she owns).
- It displays an HTML table summarizing all of a user‚Äôs transactions ever, listing row by row each and every buy and every sell.
